        I challenge you to watch the movie Freedom Writers on Netflix and read  The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. I challenge you to think about others, their situations and take that into effect when judging a person. We dont always know what is going on in someones life until you really get to know them.
